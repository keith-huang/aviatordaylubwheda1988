## How to Play Aviator: A Game Guide

### Understanding the Gameplay

The Aviator game operates on a simple premise: players place bets before
the plane takes off, and the multiplier increases as the plane ascends.
However, if the plane crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet.

### Placing Bets

1.  **Set Your Bet Amount**: Choose how much you want to wager for each
    round.
2.  **Watch the Plane Take Off**: As the plane climbs, the multiplier
    rises.
3.  **Cash Out**: You can choose to cash out at any time before the
    plane crashes. The earlier you cash out, the lower the risk, but
    waiting longer increases potential rewards.

### Strategy Tips

-   **Start with Small Bets**: This allows you to get a feel for the
    game without risking too much.
-   **Observe Patterns**: While the game is random, some players prefer
    to observe trends to inform their betting strategy.
